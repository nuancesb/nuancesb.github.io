Hello, I'm Sophie.

After spending some time (7 years exactly) working in finance, I decided to retire! I went to General Assembly (a coding bootcamp), banged my head on the table during 3 months and finally graduated (yay!).<br>

At the moment, I work as a front-end developer in a London agency. I like ruby and javascript.My mantra for 2016 is practise, practise and practise!

If you're interested about my journey or just want to say Hi! [send me an email](mailto: {{ site.email}})!
